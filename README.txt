OpenBlock
=========

OpenBlock is a web application that allows users to browse and search
their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see what's going on
recently in the immediate geographic area.

For installation instructions and other documentation, see
http://openblockproject.org/docs/ (or the .rst files in the docs/ directory).

For help, you can try the ebcode group:
http://groups.google.com/group/ebcode
or look for us in the #openblock IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.


About the Project
=================

OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
project at http://openblockproject.org.

Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
development of OpenBlock is provided by the Knight Foundation
(http://www.knightfoundation.org/).
