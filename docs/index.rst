=========
OpenBlock
=========

OpenBlock is a web application that allows users to browse and search
their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see what's going on
recently in the immediate geographic area.


History
=======

OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
`Everyblock.com
<http://everyblock.com>`_ in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
project at http://openblockproject.org.

Funding for both the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
development of OpenBlock was provided by the `Knight Foundation
<http://www.knightfoundation.org/>`_.


For Developers
==============

This is a Django application, so it's highly recommended that you have
familiarity with the Django Web framework. The best places to learn
are the official `Django documentation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_ and
the free `Django Book <http://www.djangobook.com/>`_.

Before you dive in, it's *highly* recommended you spend a little bit of
time browsing around http://demo.openblockproject.org and/or
http://EveryBlock.com to get a feel for what this software does.

Also, for a light conceptual background on some of this, particularly
the data storage aspect of :doc:`packages/ebpub`, watch the video "Behind the
scenes of EveryBlock.com" here: http://blip.tv/file/1957362
