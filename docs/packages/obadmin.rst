Administrative UI, installation and utilities package for OpenBlock.

The oblock command
==================

``oblock`` is a command-line program that gets installed with
obadmin. It provides commands to help install and manage openblock and
its database(s).  This is purely optional, but the
:doc:`demo setup script <../demo_setup>` uses it quite a bit.

Try running ``oblock help`` to see all the available commands.
Each "task" can be run as a subcommand, like ``oblock sync_all``.
